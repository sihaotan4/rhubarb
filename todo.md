study python FFI - being able to call functions on the SetRegistry in python
maybe the way to think about this is like a dataframe construct
- loading data into it
- a bit like an in memory DB
- and then providing a set of APIs which can act on the construct and return data
- in this case our API is a query language like this (A OR ((C AND B) OR D)) 

Treat this as SetQL (Set Query Language)
